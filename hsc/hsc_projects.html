					<h1>Mobile Cart Build</h1>
					<h2>01/30/2018</h2>
					<p>For this session we built out our mobile cart for moving our lab between locations. Although this night wasn't filled with technology demos and information, we got a chance to discuss the roadmap for our club. Thank you to everyone who helped setup our lab environment! We look forward to the next session!</p>

					<h1>Initial Server Buildout</h1>
					<h2>12/14/2017</h2>
					<p>This week was our first session! A few different people brought in hardware, and we got a chance to discuss how easy it ease to build your own server at home. We covered using various tools online to choose components and put together inexpensive builds. Additionally, we discussed projects we're interested in working on, and started organizing them into upcoming sessions. Thank you to everyone who joined us for our first session!</p>
